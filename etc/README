Hatari on constrained devices
-----------------------------

Note: Comments in the toplevel Makefile-default.cnf file suggest
suitable compilation options for different platforms.

In this directory are Hatari configurations files for mobile etc
devices on which the builtin Hatari defaults aren't appropriate.
Just copy suitable config file to the device /etc/ directory (or
to /usr/local/etc directory if Hatari is installed under /usr/local)
as 'hatari.cfg'.

If these configuration settings don't provide sufficient performance,
use of an earlier Hatari version such as v0.95 (or even earlier)
should be considered. Their emulation wasn't as accurate as in latest
Hatari versions and therefore they're somewhat faster.


n810.cfg
--------

Configuration file for the Nokia 770/N800/N810 TI Omap2 based devices:
- Shortcut keys adapted for the device keys:
  - Menu, Increase, Decrease, Fullscreen, Joystick keyemu fire
- Max Hatari screen size set to device screen size
- Options that are more suitable for the device performance:
  - Non-compatible, but faster CPU mode (works fine with most things)
  - No Falcon DSP emulation
  - High spec512 threshold
  - Automatic frameskip
- Sensible default paths even for things that don't yet exist (to minimize
  typing when they're enabled as N770 & N800 don't have a keyboard and N810
  keyboard is very small so typing is quite awkward)


win-ce.cfg
----------

Configuration file for Windows Mobile based devices:
- Start in fullscreen mode
- Smaller border values / screen size limited to 320x240 resolution
- Options that are more suitable for the device performance:
  - Non-compatible (but faster) CPU mode
  - Frameskip enabled
  - High spec512 threshold
  - 11kHz sound
