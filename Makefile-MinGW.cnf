# Makefile configuration for Hatari.

# You can change BUILD_HOST to :
#  windows : use mingw as a native compiler under windows
#  linux : use mingw as a cross compiler for windows under linux
#
# If you choose BUILD_HOST=linux, you should adapt MINGW_PREFIX to match
# the naming used by your distribution.
